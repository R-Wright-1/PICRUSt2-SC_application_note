# PICRUSt2-SC application note

This repository contains all of the code used for building the new PICRUSt2-SC database, adding and testing the splitting of scripts to the PICRUSt2 github repository, and running tests with the PICRUSt2-SC vs PICRUSt2-oldIMG databases and plotting figures for the application note. It is currently a bit messy as it contains everything that I have used (and all of the things that didn't work along the way), but as we move through the publication process I'll aim to streamline it to only the code that has actually ended up being used for the final database and manuscript.
